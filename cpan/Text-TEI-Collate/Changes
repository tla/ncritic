Revision history for Text::TEI::Collate

2.0	 Mon 25 Jul 2011

* Rewrote core diff algorithm - collation is now a lot slower but
  rather more accurate, or at least it should be.
* Fixed use of default canonizer / comparator for manuscript words
* Fixed testing dependency on Graph::Easy, for real this time

1.2	 Mon 18 Jul 2011

* Fixed testing dependency on Graph::Easy
* Fixed SVG generation where dot string too long for perl / dot to handle

1.1	 Sat 16 Jul 2011

And here I thought I would never return to this software.

* Changed API to separate manuscript / word source parsing from word
  alignment.  See Text::TEI::Collate docs for new usage.
* Converted ::Manuscript and ::Word modules to use Moose.
* Added output methods for alignment display as JSON, TEI XML,
  GraphML, and SVG.
* Added default word comparator / normalizer from Unicode::Normalize.
* Added some more tests.
