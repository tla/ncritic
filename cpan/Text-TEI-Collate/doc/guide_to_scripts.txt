show_columns.pl - Takes a bunch of texts, whether in plaintext or XML
format, and outputs the collation results in tabular format.  Can
output as text table or as CSV, or even as a "storable" object for use
with the other scripts once you're satisfied with the collation
itself.

see_links.pl - Another visualization script; just shows the "similar"
vs. "different variant" links between the matched words.

make_apparatus.pl - Takes a bunch of texts (or a Storable object as
produced by show_columns) and outputs parallel-segmentation TEI XML.

do_edit.pl - Takes the output of make_apparatus and presents the user
with the editing choices that must be made.  Simple STDIN/STDOUT
interface.

stemma_data.pl - Takes collation output and creates a file suitable
for analysis in a PARS package,
e.g. http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/MobylePortal/portal.py?form=pars
