This is a scholarly text collation program, which has been used
successfully for editing the Armenian-language Chronicle of Matthew of
Edessa.  Its documentation and test suite is half-done, its
functionality is mostly there but not complete, and there are some
improvements to the algorithm that are crying out to be made.  I am
releasing it anyway in hopes that it may be useful, and I will be
working to improve it in future.
