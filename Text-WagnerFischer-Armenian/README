Text::WagnerFischer::Armenian is an extension of the module
Text::WagnerFischer.  It implements WagnerFischer string distances in
a way that takes the vagaries of Armenian grammar and orthography into
account.


PREREQUISITES

Text::WagnerFischer::Armenian needs Unicode support; it therefore
depends on Perl 5.8.3 or later.  It also requires the module
Text::WagnerFischer, although it is not a real subclass of that
module.


INSTALLATION

Installation is done in the usual way:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (optional)
   make install


DOCUMENTATION

For further information, consult the POD module documentation.

   perldoc Text::WagnerFischer::Armenian

The POD viewer does not display the Armenian characters correctly;
however, transcriptions are provided just below the examples
themselves.
