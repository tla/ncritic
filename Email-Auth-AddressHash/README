SYNOPSIS

Email::Auth::AddressHash is a module for email recipient-based
authentication.  It uses the sender's email address to create a unique
hash key for that sender, and checks the sender address against the
recipient's email address extension (that is, everything between the
'+' and the '@' in an email address) to authenticate the sender.  This
module is primarily intended for applications which handle email-based
requests.

For more information see the module documentation.
