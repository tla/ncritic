This is a first release of a scholarly text collation program, which
was successfully used for editing the Armenian-language Chronicle of
Matthew of Edessa.  Its documentation is half-done, its functionality
is mostly okay but not complete, and there are some improvements that
are crying out to be made.  I am releasing it anyway in hopes that it
may be useful, and I will be working to improve it in future.
