deal with corrections.  Need to represent both original and scribe-corrected form in MSS; would also possibly make a difference in stemmatology.

For representation, correction needs to be represented with entire word if possible.  Whole word corrections thus easy.  Mid-word corrections probably need editorial assistance, dammit.  May have to go through and add sensical corrected variants to the apparatus manually for now.

For stemmatology, need to say at editing time whether the original word or its correction should be used for genealogical purposes.  Yet another decision to make.

Really I want to match up everything between and including two "sames".
