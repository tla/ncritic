For the core libraries:
- write tests for gap detection and 2-word glommed matching
- Decide if it is really useful to differentiate between
  "orthographic" and "spelling" variation
- Do a better job of comparing the words in a new text with the
  "chained" alternative words that have already been collated.  This
  would not be hard to do, it just hasn't been done.
- Handle transposition properly
- Pull some of the TEI XML generation into the core library


For the editing scripts:
- Allow reading group assignments on the command line
- Safeguards against selecting something twice
- Ability to back up and re-examine a choice
- Have a filter for what sort of punctuation we care about.  Or just
  use it more effectively.
- Write a rule for capital / lowercase orthography
- Need a way to mark a witDetail as "use this", rather than consuming it.
- ...Should definitely put it in a <c type="punct"/> container.
- Handle catchwords appropriately (i.e. don't collate them.)
